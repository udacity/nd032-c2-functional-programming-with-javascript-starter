// 1. Create a function that when passed as a callback to the Higher Order function provided, makes the final return the number's square plus two
const addTwo = (callback) => {
  return num() + 2
}

// 2. Create a Higher Order Function that could take this callback to return a greeting
const createFullName = (first_name, last_name, title) => {
  return `${title} ${first_name} ${last_name}`
}
// you might notice that this function is less than ideal - that's great! We'll talk about why next
